In cases of previous treatment with the pheyntoin and the addition of phenobarbital or of primidone, unpredictable changes:

--the plasma concentrations of phenytoin are most often decreased (increase of the metabolism) without this decrease affecting the anticonvulsant activity unfavorably. When the phenobarbital or the primidone is stopped, possibility of toxic effects of the phenytoin.

--it can happen that the concentrations of phenytoin are increased (inhibition of the metabolism due to competition)</DESCRIPTION>
